Use the Script Editor and Explorer. Do not paste this document or any script into
the Command Bar. There is no generated installer or serialized source wrapper.

## Step-by-step

1. Open a new Roblox Studio place and stop Play mode. Keep HTTP Requests and Studio
   API Services access disabled. No publication, Node process or plugin is needed.
2. Open Explorer and Properties from Studio's View/Window menu.
3. Under **ServerScriptService**, insert three **ModuleScript** instances. Name
   them exactly **Config**, **RealmState**, and **World** (without `.lua`).
4. Under **ServerScriptService**, insert one normal **Script** named **Realm**.
   Its source is the file `Realm.server.lua`. Leave RunContext at Legacy/default.
5. Expand **StarterPlayer → StarterPlayerScripts**. Insert one **LocalScript**
   named **Realm** there. Its source is `Realm.client.lua`. This client script
   belongs in StarterPlayerScripts, not StarterCharacterScripts or the server.
6. Double-click each instance to open its Script Editor. Select **all** of its
   default/template text and replace it with its matching complete source below.
   Copy only the code inside that file's code block, without Markdown fences.
   In a raw file preview, copy the source itself. Do not combine the five files.
7. Make sure the server Script and LocalScript are enabled. Finish all five files
   before pressing Play. Do not keep duplicate Realm server/client scripts active.
8. Press **Play**, not Run. The server creates the islands, stand-in avatars, event
   objects and money/round state; the LocalScript builds the player HUD.
9. Open **Keeper Tools**, enter `Alice_01`, and click **Open the Star Gate**. Repeat
   with `Bobby_02`. Usernames label locally built avatars; no account is fetched.
10. Click **Awaken a Storm**. Use the main Ward/Sail buttons for your player, or
    enter a joined username in Keeper Tools and use **Vote as: Ward / Sail**.
    Watch balances/leaderboards during voting and the storm. Base income is $5/s;
    voting adds $3/s that round. Successful rounds add $2/s for subsequent rounds.
11. With a joined username in the input, try **Gift bloom**, **Gift aurora** and
    **Gift giant**. They expire after 18 seconds and do not change income or votes.
    **Simulate Follow** counts a session-only follow. All events are offline demos.
12. Stop and Play again to confirm all money, crew, gifts, follows and shards reset.

Expected Explorer tree:

```text
ServerScriptService
├── Config       (ModuleScript)
├── RealmState   (ModuleScript)
├── World        (ModuleScript)
└── Realm        (Script; source: Realm.server.lua)
StarterPlayer
└── StarterPlayerScripts
    └── Realm    (LocalScript; source: Realm.client.lua)
```

The server's three `require(script.Parent.NAME)` calls refer to the three sibling
ModuleScripts above. Config, RealmState and World each return their module table.
The client requires no modules; it waits for `ReplicatedStorage.Riftbound` and its
Snapshot, Action and Notice RemoteEvents, which the server creates automatically.
Do not create those remotes or install anything from `integrations/` manually.

All game data is in memory, with `PersistenceEnabled = false`. These sources have
no save-service access, HTTP calls, external asset fetches, or TikTok connection.
Roblox Studio/engine behavior still requires a local Windows/macOS playtest.
